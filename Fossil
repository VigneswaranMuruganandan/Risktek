Fossil fuels are the main source of energy around the world. However, people are being encouraged to use alternative energy sources such as wind energy, solar energy and so on. Do you think this is a positive or negative development? why?

The world has witnessed revolutionary inventions in terms of science and technology with energy generation being the most prominent. In many countries, main source of energy is fossil fuels but some industrialized nations are welcoming to use renewable sources like wind, solar and tidal energy. However, this thriving trend is definitely a positive development.

Fundamentally, the predominant factors that evidently trigger it can be observed. First and foremost, wind and solar power are environmentally friendly because they do not release any toxic gases into the atmosphere after exploiting them. The result of using these sources is to create electricity to power such vehicles as trams and electric cars, which are widely used in most parts of the world and do not release carbon dioxide. Unlike fossil fuels including coal, petroleum, and oil, they are of necessity to power petroleum-consumed transports. This, however, poses a problem to the environment such as global warming due to the excessive amount of toxic gases emitted into the air.
