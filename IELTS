Dear Sir,

My name is Vigneswaran and I am the member of your sports club “Lifeline”. I am writing this letter in response to the notice which I have received from your end regarding the suggestions for improving the building of sports club.

This club plays vital role in health and fitness development for me and my family. I have been a member of this club from last 4 years. There are umpteen of people getting benefited with this sports club. Based on weekly and monthly basis competitions, it triggers people to participate in sports which acts as fitness development and stress buster for all.

Moreover, building requires urgent refurbishment. Most of the doors and windows are fragile, hence need replacement. Also, there is no proper sitting arrangement after playing for long hours. Lastly, washrooms, changing rooms and swimming pool water has to be cleaned and maintained every 2 days.

In order to maintain the strength of your sports club members for upcoming year, it is paramount significant that all these changes has to implemented expeditiously. If changes are done, sports club will get back its glory and increase the volume of club members. 

Hoping for kind consideration of these suggestions.

Yours faithfully,
Vigneswaran
