Hi Velayutham,
As discussed over the call, I have taken Housing Loan in SBI (Loan Account No: 00000033435704486) and recently I have cleared Total outstanding loan balance by transferring the complete pending amount to the respected loan account.
But as ECS deduction is still active and its deducting  from my HDFC Account. Please find the transaction below for your reference which was deducted from my HDFC Account (ACC NO : 04411610030414) 
As Iâ€™m outside India location, unable to visit the branch. Hence kindly do the needful to stop the ECS deduction and revert back the below transaction amount to my HDFC account or SBI account.
